      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        There are two tabs on that page: "VERIFIED" and "UNVERIFIED". You may
        find all your "Qualified Referrals" under "VERIFIED" tab. The referral
        with "Redeemed" status indicates that the reward for the referral has
        been issued, while the referral with "Processing" status indicates that
        the reward for the referral is yet to be issued.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        You may find all your other referral attempts under "UNVERIFIED" tab and
        the stages they're at. If the referral has been "Invited", it means that
        this Referee is still going through the registration process and is yet
        to be verified. If the referral has been "Rejected", it means that this
        Referee has been rejected by our audit team because they don't qualify
        as per Hirect's standards or need to reupload the relevant documents.

        </span>
        'Hirect' may offer products and services for purchase on the App
        (“In-App Purchase”). By making an in-app purchase, you agree to the
        payment terms that may apply, which are disclosed at the point of
        purchase, and as such, the payment terms are incorporated herein by
        reference.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        In-App Purchases can be made by the following methods ("Payment
        Method"): (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform such as
        the Apple App Store or Google Play Store ("Third Party Store"). As soon
        as you make an In-App Purchase, you authorise us to charge your chosen
        Payment Method. If we cannot receive payment through the selected
        Payment Method, then you agree to pay all sums due upon demand by us.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        The subscription is not cancelled when an account is deleted, or an
        application is deleted from a device. You will be notified of any
        changes to the pricing of the Premium Services to which you have
        subscribed and given the opportunity to cancel. If we change these
        prices and you do not cancel the subscription, you will be charged at
        Hirect's then-current subscription pricing.

        If you have purchased a subscription through a Third Party Store, such
        as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, you will need to access
        your account with that Third Party Store and follow instructions to
        change or cancel their subscription. If you cancel your subscription,
        you may continue to use the paid services until the end of the period
        you last paid for, but (i) you will not (except as outlined in the
        subsection entitled “Refunds” below) be eligible for a prorated refund,
        (iii) you will then no longer be able to use the Premium Services or
        In-App Purchases enabled by their subscription.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        Refunds. Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and
        there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.

        You may cancel your subscription without penalty or obligation. Your
        estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any subscription
        payment you had made, which is allocated to the period after your death
        if you die before the end of your subscription period. Suppose you
        become disabled (so that you cannot use Hirect) before the end of your
        subscription period. In that case, you are entitled to a refund of that
        portion of your subscription payment transferable to the period after
        your disability by providing the company notice in the same manner that
        you request a refund.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        Suppose you exercise your right of cancellation (except for purchases
        made through Apple ID, which Apple controls). In that case, we will
        refund (or ask Google to refund) all payments received from you, without
        undue delay and, in any case, within 14 days of the date when we
        received notification of your decision to cancel the Agreement. we shall
        make such a refund using the same means of payment as used by you in the
        initial transaction. In any case, you will not be charged any fees due
        to the refund.
      </p>
      <p class="policy-item-desc">
        You who purchased through a payment platform other than those listed
        above should request a refund directly from the third-party merchant
        through which you made the purchase.
